# Smart Small Scale Broiler Poultry Farm Monitoring and Control System

A Design Project presented to the Faculty of the Computer Engineering Department, College of Engineering and Architecture of University of the Cordilleras.

In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering.

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for the "Smart Small Scale Broiler Poultry Farm Monitoring and Control System," a design project presented to the Faculty of the Computer Engineering Department at the University of the Cordilleras as part of the requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering degree.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a comprehensive system for monitoring and controlling various parameters in a broiler poultry farm environment. Key objectives include:

1. **Environmental Parameters Monitoring:** Implementing real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, and ammonia (NH3) levels to create optimal conditions for chicken growth.

2. **Feed and Water Storage Monitoring:** Measuring and visualizing water and feed levels in storage containers to ensure resource availability.

3. **Automated Environmental Parameters Control:** Regulating the environment through automated mechanisms like heaters, fans, humidifiers, and exhaust fans.

4. **Feeder and Light Control:** Providing controlled management of feeding processes and lighting conditions for chickens.

## Features

### Mobile/Website Dashboard (Blynk Application)

- Integrated with the Blynk platform for remote monitoring and control.
- Real-time sensor data collection and display, including temperature, humidity, ammonia gas concentration, water, and feed levels.
- Control over the feeder and lighting through the Blynk app.
- Email notifications for critical events, such as high ammonia levels.

### Environmental Parameters Monitoring

- Continuous monitoring of temperature, humidity, and ammonia gas using sensors like DHT22 and MQ137.
- Dynamic adjustment of environmental parameters based on chicken growth stages.

### Feed and Water Storage Monitoring

- Precise measurement of water and feed levels using ultrasonic sensors.
- Real-time display of resource availability on the Blynk app.

### Automated Environmental Control

- Dynamic control of temperature and humidity levels through devices like heaters, fans, and humidifiers.
- Enhancement of the overall well-being and productivity of chickens.

### Feeder and Light Control

- Automation of feeding processes and lighting conditions.
- Regulation of biological rhythms and welfare of the chickens.
